Q1. It is your choice to use either an ordered or unordered set. In a few sentences, what are some of the tradeoffs between the two? Additionally, please give an example (that has not been shown in lecture) of a valid hash function that could be used to hash student names for an unordered set.
A1. Use an ordered set, since i have to iterate through the set to check if the names stored in it has the same initials as my name. 

Q2. Note that we are saving pointers to names in the queue, not names themselves. Why might this be desired in this problem? What happens if the original set where the names are stored goes out of scope and the pointers are referenced?
A2. By saving pointers, the queue efficiently use less memory to store information of names without continuously copy the names. It's fine that the orignal set goes out of scope, the pointers will find the address of the strings stored in the set.
